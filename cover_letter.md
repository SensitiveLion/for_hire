Dear Hiring Manager,

<!-- ---Custom Section
I wanted to submit my resume and convey my interest in the Developer role found @ http://www.jobs4me.com/rails-developer. I've been a long time admirer of 37Signals. In fact, we used Basecamp extensively as part of our partner projects at Launch Academy! As you'll see based on my resume and through my code examples, the philosophies that Launch Academy have taught me are well aligned with the way in which 37Signals builds software.

Due to my previous position as an effective inside sales rep, I have a unique perspective on how a customer would use such a product. I'd love to share some specific thoughts I've had on some small interface tweaks that would make things easier for salespeople.

---Boilerplate
During my time at Launch Academy, I build a user  centric designed learning  that heavily incorporates . As part of my partner project, we build a great review  application that incorporates OmniAuth with facebook and google-based authorization. You can find these applications at http://github.com/sensitivelion/learnit and http://github.com/sensitivelion/cardboard respectively. As you'll see from my code examples, I'm a huge proponent of Agile development methodologies.

I'd love to share more about my background with you and to show you that I strive to exceed expectations in everything that I do. I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Andy Passidomo


I believe I will be perfect for this internship  because after completing Launch Academy  where I learned full stack Ruby on Rails development I have continued to learn on my own. I love having a problem i don't know how to solve right away and being able to learn a new way to solve it. Having experience working pair programing, in a group, as well as on my own I can work well as part of a team as well as solo.

In a previous job doing IT support and computer repair I would visit the customers house and help the solve their computer problems in person. I was important to have good communication to be able so figure out the symptoms of the problem and what they want to be done about it.

I'd love to share more about my background with you and to show you that I strive to exceed expectations in everything that I do. I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Andy Passidomo
